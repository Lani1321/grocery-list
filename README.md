# Dont forget the eggs! #

Welcome!  Don't forget the eggs is a standard Sinatra Web App.  It allows a user to add multiple grocery lists in case you need a separate list for every event in your life like I do.  Whether it's for your weekly grocery shopping or a grocery list for a BBQ or a Birthday Party. You can add, edit, or delete a list and add items as you please! Try it out and see for yourself!
